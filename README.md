# QAOANeural with PyTorch (currently a work in progress)
## Using NN for QAOA angles
Based on my own repository [QAOANeural](https://github.com/jedwvv/QAOANeural). I carry over some of the code.  
Same objective of using NN for predicting QAOA angles but using more sophisticated models with PyTorch.  

## Goals for improvements over QAOANeural:
1. Better datasets with more meaningful features.  
2. Better feature selection.  
3. GPU training (using PyTorch CUDA).  
4. Varied NN structures.  
5. Varied activation functions that may be more suitable for output of continuous values.
