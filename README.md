# QAOANeural with PyTorch (currently a work in progress)
## Using NN for QAOA angles
Based on my own repository [QAOANeural](https://github.com/jedwvv/QAOANeural). I carry over some of the code.  
Same objective of using NN for predicting QAOA angles but using more sophisticated models with PyTorch.  

## Goals for improvements over QAOANeural:
1. Varied dataset structures, such as various classes of Hamiltonian graphs and weights.  
2. Better feature selection from the Hamiltonians.  
3. GPU training using PyTorch CUDA.  
4. Varied NN structures.  
5. Varied activation functions.
